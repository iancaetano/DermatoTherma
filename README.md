## **Mission of DermatoTherma**
We provide safe and affordable tools for a healthy and more equal world.

We aim to support people worldwide with accessible and easy-to-use tools to combat neglected diseases.

Since 2022 our team has been committed to developing state-of-the-art hyperthermia technology and researching application areas where we can make a difference in the lives of individuals. By bringing our device to the market and focusing on impact rather than revenue, we want to create a world without neglect and fear of harmful treatment side effects.
